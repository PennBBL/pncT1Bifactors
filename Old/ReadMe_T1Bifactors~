    sudo -u pncnmf sudosh
    cd /cbica/projects/pncNmf/n282_preterm/results/NumBases26/OPNMF/niiImg
    tar -cvf NMF26components.tar.gz Basis_*

2. Copy the files to chead
    scp -r NMF26components.tar.gz akaczkurkin@chead.uphs.upenn.edu:/data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/results

3. Unzip the files
    tar -xvf NMF26components.tar.gz
    
4. Look at the results
    fslview /data/joy/BBL/studies/pnc/template/pnc_template_brain_2mm.nii.gz $(for i in {1..26}; do echo `ls Basis_${i}.nii ` -b 0.004,0.04 -l Hot ; done) &

5. Warp your NMF component .nii files into MNI space for caret:
   a. Use the script "WarpEachToMNI.sh"

6. Use sftp to download the MNI space files to the local computer (the files will be in Machintosh HD/Users/antoniak or look for them in "All My Files").
    get /data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/results/EachComponentWarpedToMNI/NMF*

7. Open Caret (Applications/caret/bin_macosx64/caret5)
   a. If opening a spec file for the first time:
      1. Go to File -> Open Spec file...
      2. Computer/Applications/caret/data_files/standard_mesh_atlases/standard_mesh_atlases_TED/Human.PALS.LEFT
      3. Load
   b. Or if you have already opened a spec file before:
      1. File -> Open recent Spec file -> /standard_mesh_atlases_TED/Human.PALS.LEFT
      2. Load
   c. Go to Attributes -> Map volume(s) to surface(s)
      1. Choose Metric -> Next
      2. Add Volume from disk
         a. Navigate to where you saved the NMF nii files
         b. Choose the NMF_1.nii file
         c. Open
         d. Next
      3. Map to caret with atlas
         a. Space: Choose FLIRT
         b. Atlas: Choose the hemisphere that matches the spec file you loaded (LEFT hemisphere).
         c. Only select "Show Mapping to Average Fiducial Surface" (the first button).
         d. Okay
         e. Next
      4. Data File naming
         a. Don't change anything
         b. Next
      5. Mapping Algorithm
         a. Choose: METRIC_MAXIMUM_VOXEL
         b. Next
         c. Finish
         d. Wait for the summary box to appear. Close.
   d. On the caret diaglog box:
      1. Click on D/C
      2. Primary Overlay, Data type: Choose Metric.
      3. Use the M and L buttons at the top of the screen to switch views quickly.
      4. At the top of the D/C page, change Page Selection to Metric Settings
         a. Click on User scale, play with Pos Min/Max to get a good view of the clusters (ask Ted for range to use); For NMF, I used .009 and .04.
         b. Change color palette, if desired
         c. Display mode = Positive, Negative, or Both (depends if you have positive and negative results); NMF is positive only.
         d. Check the box "Display color bar"
   e. Custom color palettes in caret:
      1. Go to Attributes
      2. Palette
      3. Edit...
      4. New...
      5. Give it a name, OK
      6. Choose either "New Empty Palette" for a blank palette or "Copy Palette" if you are adjusting an existing palette
      7. Click on the + sign to add rows or - to delete rows.
      8. Click on the color button (may say "missing" at first) to change colors
      9. NOTE: the numbers next to the palette color names define the range of the palette. Depending on the data you want to plot, you may need to do trial and error to get these numbers to cover the range of your data.
      10. When done adjusting colors, take a screen shot (command-shift-4) to document the palette colors and numbers to recreate later. The palette will not be saved when you close Caret or load a new spec file.
      11. To apply to your image:
          a. Click on D/C
          b. Change Page Selection to Metric Settings
          c. Your palette should now appear in the Palette dropdown menu.
          d. You may need to choose Positive only if your palette range only contains positive numbers.
   f. Capture high resolution pictures:
      1. Once you are happy with the settings above, go to
         a. File
         b. Capture image of window
         c. Check "Popup Dialogue to Adjust Captured Image Size"
         d. Check "Save to File"
         e. Click on "Name..."
         f. Navigate to folder where you want to save the image and name it. Choose Save to close window.
         g. Click on "Capture"
         h. When the image size box appears, change resolution to 300 Pixels/inch and choose OK.
         i. File should be saved in the folder you specified. 



#######################################################
#### MAKE A SINGLE FIGURE WITH ALL NMF COMPONENTS ####
#######################################################

1. Threshold and binarize each image using the script "ThresholdBinarizeNMF.sh". This script will:
   a. Threshold each Basis_*.nii image output from the NMF analyses at .004 (this threshold value was recommended by Aris).
   b. Binarize these thresholded images and save separately.
   c. This has to be done separately because we need both thresholded only images and thresholded/binarized images.

2. Remove small clusters
   a. Use Adon’s matlab code to remove small clusters.
      1. Copy the function "returnNumberOfNeighboorhoods" from scripts/ to your results folder /Threshold004Bin
      2. The input needs to be the thresholded (.004) and binarized images.
      3. You have to try several different thresholds to make sure it’s not cutting out the main clusters (200, 300, anf 400 are reasonable to try).
         a. I ultimately went with 400, consistent with Marieta's CT study.
      4. This produces a binary mask with the remaining clusters

      matlab -nodisplay -nojvm -r "returnNumberOfNeighboorhoods('./Basis_1_thr004Bin.nii.gz', 400); exit;"

      5. mkdir NeighborThresh400 and move the images into this folder
3. Mask the thresholded (.004) images by the masks you just created using the script "MaskByNeighborThr400.sh".
4. Warp the masked image into 2mm MNI space for loading in caret using the script "WarpThr400ToMNI.sh".
5. Merge all NMF component images into a single 4D image 
   a. NOTE: If you do not have the -1v flag for ls, the images will be merged in the order they are found in the results folder (10, 11, 12, ..., 19, 1, 20, 21, etc.) which is out of order.

fslmerge -t /data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/results/n282_26NmfComponentsMerged.nii.gz $(ls -1v /data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/results/MaskedByNeighborThresh400_WarpedToMNI/Basis_*_thr004_maskedByNeighborThr400_2mmMNI.nii.gz)

6. Confirm that components are in the 4D image (Note: If you overlay on a template brain, then you will only see the first component)
   a. fslview n282_26NmfComponentsMerged.nii.gz
   b. Click on the "Movie Mode" button to cycle through all 26 components
      1. NOTE: Each volume = 1 component (they are listed as 0-25, not 1-26 in fslview but this does not affect the CompositeNmfBrainImage.R script).
7. Warp and binarize the mask using the script "WarpBinMask.sh".
8. Use the script "CompositeNmfBrainImage.R" to assigning a p-value or t-value to each component for loading into caret.
   a. NOTE: You will need to run the script "GamAnalyses.R" to see which NMF components you want to plot.
9. Look at the output
     cd /data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures
     #All 26 components
     fslview /share/apps/fsl/5.0.8/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz NMF_preterm_all26Components.nii.gz -l Random-Rainbow &
     #Only the components that survive FDR correction
     fslview /share/apps/fsl/5.0.8/data/standard/MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz NMF_preterm_gaFdrComponents.nii.gz -b 2,4.5 -l Red-Yellow &
10. Use sftp to download the composite image to the local computer (the files will be in Machintosh HD/Users/antoniak or look for it in "All My Files").
     get /data/joy/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/NMF_preterm_gaFdrComponents.nii.gz
11. Load the file "NMF_preterm_gaFdrComponents.nii.gz" in caret as above, except:
    a. Make Pos Min/Max = 2 and 4.0
    b. Display mode = Positive
    c. Check the box "Display color bar"
    d. Make palette = "clear-brain"
    e. Include color bar in screen shot

   b. Run GAM models
   c. Pull the FDR-corrected signficant ROI names, p values, and t values into a dataframe
   d. Save as a .csv file

2. Clone github folder with scripts
   cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures
   git clone git@github.com:PennBBL/jlfVisualizer.git

3. Load the functions in R (you don't need to change anything in this script)
   cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/Rfunction
   R
   source("makeITKSnapColorTable.R")

4. Load ROI names, p values, and t values   
   x<-read.csv("/data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/subjectData/pncPreterm_JLF_ROIs.csv", header=TRUE)
   
5. Create the color table and key (tells you which colors go with which ROIs)
   NOTE: These will be saved here: /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/subjectData and are named pncPreterm_jlf-ColorTable.txt and pncPreterm_jlf-KEY.csv
   writeColorTableandKey(x, 3, "pncPreterm_jlf", minTmp=c(-1, 0), maxTmp=c(min(x[,3]), max(x[,3])))

6. Now make the color coordinated image (the output is "outputImage.nii.gz" in /bash) and move it to a folder of its own (/JLF_lateral)
   cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/bash
   ./makeZScoreJLFPNCTemplateImage.sh /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/Rfunction/pncPreterm_jlf-KEY.csv 4 1 Cortical

7. Now open up the image in itk snap (you may have to downgrade to XQuartz 2.7.8 to get this to work)
   ssh -Y akaczkurkin@chead.uphs.upenn.edu
   cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/bash/JLF_lateral
   itksnap -g ../../../data/pnc_template_brain.nii.gz -s outputImage.nii.gz -l /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/Rfunction/pncPreterm_jlf-ColorTable.txt

   c. Name the screenshot and save (it will be saved in /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/data)

10. To make an medial image of just one hemisphere:
    a. First create new JLF cortical lookup files with just one hemisphere or the other
       cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/data
       cat jlf_lookupCortical.csv | grep R_ > jlf_lookupCorticalR.csv 
       cat jlf_lookupCortical.csv | grep L_ > jlf_lookupCorticalL.csv
    b. Make the color coordinated image (the output is "outputImage.nii.gz" in /bash and will overwrite prior outputImages)
       cd /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/bash/JLF_medial_R
       ./makeZScoreJLFPNCTemplateImage.sh /data/jux/BBL/projects/pncPreterm/tablesFigures/jlfVisualizer/scripts/Rfunction/pncPreterm_jlf-KEY.csv 4 1 CorticalR
